Hi <%= @email %>,

Someone (hopefully you) asked to send you a list of all the AKAs associated with your e-mail address at <%= Myaka::Application.config.myaka_domain %>.
<% if @akas.empty? %>

Turns out, we don't have any AKAs in our records with this e-mail address.
<% elsif @akas.size == 1 %>

You have one: <%= @akas[0].domain_name %> (login: <%= @akas[0].subdomain %>)
<% else %>

Here are all <%= @akas.size %> of them:
<% @akas.each do |aka| %>
 - <%= aka.domain_name %> (login: <%= aka.subdomain %>)
<% end %>
<% end %>

Thank you for your support of Project AKA.
